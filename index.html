                Hi, my name is Lauren (or as most of my friends call me...Lemmy!) and I am huge supporter of literature, history and adventures! When you mix all of those together you end up with a great travel partner because I love learning about a place before I head there and always throw in local flavor and unique activities.

                    Hi, my name is Lauren (or as most of my friends call me...Lemmy!) and I am huge supporter of literature, history and adventures!

                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I was fortunate enough to travel out of the country (to Brazil...TWICE) at a young age and this sparked a light in me that I have never let fade. Since then, I have been to Canada, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Alaska, Montana and have fell in love with cities like Sacramento, San Francisco, Boston, and Chicago. In the fall of 2017, I organized a New England Coast road trip for my Mom and I; we visited 3 states and 7 cities!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While Instagramming, I started getting constant feedback from friends on how they would love for me to plan them a trip. Then suddenly, I was joining the amazing team at All Things Travel in January of 2018! I am working with a group of women who have made their mark all over this world, literally, and I am so blessed to be able to learn and grow with them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So let’s figure out today where you can leave your mark. Let’s plan that trip to that city that has all been on your list or that country that inspired you years ago. It’s time to travel! Lemmy be your travel agent!​
