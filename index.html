                    Rachel has found her home at All Things Travel and is excited to be surrounded by so many others with great experience. From Disney trips for the family to romantic Caribbean getaways for two, Rachel would love to help you plan your dream vacation.

                    Hi! My name is Kendra and traveling has been my thing for years. Moving from New York City to a small town east of Memphis definitely had its challenges but never stopped the traveling that was always done.  Each year I plan an international vacation for myself and what some would call a local vacation to explore this wonderful country we get to call home. Being a child of a Jamaican citizen has allowed me to take numerous vacation to various Caribbean islands with Jamaica being my second home. I can help you plan your next adventure either to a city near you or an amazing tropical beach!  I would love to help you make your travel dreams come true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have always had a passion for details-when I was younger I always wondered why a particular person planned our trips.  Being able to be a part of ALL THINGS TRAVEL has allowed me to be the person planning those trips.  Allow me to help you and be that support to plan your next getaway.
