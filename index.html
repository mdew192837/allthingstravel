                    Hi! My name is Kendra and traveling has been my thing for years. Moving from New York City to a small town east of Memphis definitely had its challenges but never stopped the traveling that was always done.  Each year I plan an international vacation for myself and what some would call a local vacation to explore this wonderful country we get to call home. Being a child of a Jamaican citizen has allowed me to take numerous vacation to various Caribbean islands with Jamaica being my second home. I can help you plan your next adventure either to a city near you or an amazing tropical beach!  I would love to help you make your travel dreams come true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have always had a passion for details-when I was younger I always wondered why a particular person planned our trips.  Being able to be a part of ALL THINGS TRAVEL has allowed me to be the person planning those trips.  Allow me to help you and be that support to plan your next getaway.
