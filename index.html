                  <p>
                    Hi! My name is Kendra and traveling has been my thing for
                    years. Moving from New York City to a small town east of
                    Memphis definitely had its challenges but never stopped the
                    traveling that was always done. Each year I plan an
                    international vacation for myself and what some would call a
                    local vacation to explore this wonderful country we get to
                    call home. Being a child of a Jamaican citizen has allowed
                    me to take numerous vacation to various Caribbean islands
                    with Jamaica being my second home. I can help you plan your
                    next adventure either to a city near you or an amazing
                    tropical beach! I would love to help you make your travel
                    dreams come true.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I have always had a passion for details-when I was younger I
                    always wondered why a particular person planned our trips.
                    Being able to be a part of ALL THINGS TRAVEL has allowed me
                    to be the person planning those trips. Allow me to help you
                    and be that support to plan your next getaway.

                  <h4>Extended Bio - Gretchen Miller</h4>
                  <p>
                    Gretchen has been planning trips for herself, family, and
                    friends for years. Now that her nest is empty, she is
                    embarking on a new adventure at All Things Travel.
                    Gretchen's love of travel was solidified on a middle school
                    trip to Western Europe. Not only is she a certified graduate
                    of Disney's College of Knowledge for travel agents but also
                    has over 20 combined visits to DisneyWorld and DisneyLand.
                    She would love to plan your Disney trip so you can simply
                    "enjoy the ride"!

                Amy has a HUGE passion for travel. She truly enjoys the process
                of planning every little detail of each trip. She has had the

                (including Hawaii), Spain, Italy, Mexico, multiple Caribbean
